#Lab for Computer Graphics.
This progects includes implementation of the affine transformation of the crystal in 3D space.
Crystals is described by the adjacency matrix of its tops.
Crystal draws on the screen in the GraphABC window before and after transformations.
Implementation is strongly tied to the GraphABC window.
